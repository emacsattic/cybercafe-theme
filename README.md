# Cyber Cafe Theme for Emacs

Cyber Cafe is an almost colorless, white-on-black theme. Created for
distraction-less programming, knowing that syntax highlight is overrated.

## Customizing

Currently there's only a single customizable option: if you set the variable
`cybercafe-cyberpunk` to non-nil before applying the theme, more green will be
used to UI components.

## Compatibility

I've only added special support for stuff I use. Feel free to contribute support
for other modes. Most should work just with the `font-lock` support tho.
